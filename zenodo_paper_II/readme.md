 # Single column oceanic model (SCM) with Eddy-Diffusion/Mass-Flux (EDMF) closure.
- project: SCM-EDMF ocean
- authors: M. Perrot / F. Lemarié
- associated paper: Perrot M., Lemarié F., "Energetically consistent Eddy-Diffusivity Mass-Flux convective schemes. Part II: Implementation and Evaluation in an oceanic context.", submitted to JAMES, 2024.

## Installation/compilation
- go to library/fortran_src
- edit makefile with your fortran compiler 
- compile by running "make" in a terminal;  compilation is successful if a prompt 'Fortran SCM tools OK' appears
- if not, check the name of the four .so files that have been created and replace the names written in the makefile (lines 13-17) by the names generated by your system (defaults to *.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so). 
- Optional : you can generate the documentation of the fortran code using FORD
```	
cd library
ford scm_edmf.md -d ./fortran_src/ 
```
## Generate figures of the paper
- run in a terminal the file 'create_all_figures.sh'.
- go to /figures to see them
